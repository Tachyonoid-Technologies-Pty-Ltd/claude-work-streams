  Work Stream Completed: building-work-streams-plugin
  Total Duration: 13 hours 42 minutes
  Sessions: 3 (session-1: 11h 55m, session-2: 26m, session-3: 1h 12m)
  Checkpoints: 8
  Updates: 11

  Major Accomplishments:
  ✓ Created complete work streams plugin for Claude Code
  ✓ Implemented 10 comprehensive slash commands (9 stream + 1 git management)
  ✓ Built robust YAML-based metadata tracking system
  ✓ Added context monitoring with optimized thresholds (90%/95%/98%)
  ✓ Implemented intelligent context injection system (<2000 tokens)
  ✓ Full git integration with branch tracking and commit management
  ✓ Tested all core functionality including real-world context compaction scenario
  ✓ Created neutral commit message system with auto-staging

  Goals Achieved:
  ✓ Define plugin structure and core functionality
  ✓ Implement stream management commands (10 total with git integration)
  ✓ Create stream tracking and context management
  ✓ Test plugin integration with Claude Code (all commands verified)
  ✓ Full git integration with commit tracking
  ✓ Real-world testing with context compaction scenario

  Key Decisions:
  - YAML format for stream metadata (human-readable, git-friendly)
  - 10 commands total: 9 stream management + 1 git integration command
  - Storing streams in .claude/streams/ directory structure
  - Dual-level tracking: lightweight updates + full checkpoints
  - Context monitoring with optimized thresholds: <90% healthy, 95-97% warning, 98%+ critical
  - Smart context injection generates <2000 token summaries for efficient restoration
  - Stream-resume automatically integrates context injection for seamless workflow
  - Git integration: branch tracking, commit history, neutral commit messages
  - Neutral commit principles: NO AI/tool attribution, describe WHAT not HOW/WHO

  Commands Implemented:
  1. /stream-start - Initialize new work stream with goals and optional git branch
  2. /stream-checkpoint - Save progress with git state and comprehensive metadata
  3. /stream-end - Complete stream with full summary
  4. /stream-list - View all streams (active/paused/completed)
  5. /stream-resume - Continue previous work stream with auto context injection
  6. /stream-status - View detailed stream status with git integration
  7. /stream-update - Add quick timestamped progress notes
  8. /stream-context-check - Monitor context usage with optimized thresholds
  9. /stream-context-inject - Generate smart context summaries from stream history
  10. /stream-git - Complete git management (link, create, commit, status, sync, unlink)

  Session Progression:
  - Session 1 (11h 55m): Initial plugin setup, 6 core commands, context monitoring
  - Session 2 (26m): Context injection, enhanced resume, end-to-end testing
  - Session 3 (1h 12m): Full git integration, commit action, threshold optimization, real-world testing

  Real-World Testing Highlights:
  - Experienced actual context compaction at ~20% usage during session-3
  - Successfully captured all progress across compaction boundary via checkpoints
  - Demonstrated plugin's core value: seamless context management across boundaries
  - Optimized thresholds based on real usage patterns
  - Created 2 git commits with neutral messages (bd73463, 9cdb3d6)
  - Verified full workflow: checkpoint → compaction → resume → status → end

  Future Enhancements (Optional):
  - Add error handling for edge cases
  - Implement stream archiving functionality
  - Add stream search/filter capabilities
  - Create stream templates for common workflows
  - Export streams to markdown reports
  - Remote sync detection and handling
  - Multi-developer stream coordination

  Context for Future Reference:
  This plugin provides a complete system for managing continuous development work
  across multiple Claude Code sessions. It solves the context window limitation by
  enabling structured checkpoints, resumption, and progress tracking with intelligent
  context restoration. The system is self-documenting through YAML metadata, provides
  smart recommendations for checkpoint timing, and automatically generates condensed
  context summaries (<2000 tokens) when resuming work streams for efficient context
  restoration without overwhelming the context window.
