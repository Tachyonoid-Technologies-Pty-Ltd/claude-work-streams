  ✓ Create stream tracking and context management
  ✓ Test plugin integration with Claude Code (all commands verified)

  Key Decisions:
  - YAML format for stream metadata (human-readable, git-friendly)
  - 9 core commands: start, checkpoint, end, list, resume, status, update, context-check, context-inject
  - Storing streams in .claude/streams/ directory structure
  - Dual-level tracking: lightweight updates + full checkpoints
  - Context monitoring uses system token budget for accurate recommendations
  - Smart context injection generates <2000 token summaries for efficient restoration
  - Stream-resume automatically integrates context injection for seamless workflow

  Commands Implemented:
  1. /stream-start - Initialize new work stream with goals
  2. /stream-checkpoint - Save progress with comprehensive metadata
  3. /stream-end - Complete stream with full summary
  4. /stream-list - View all streams (active/paused/completed)
  5. /stream-resume - Continue previous work stream with auto context injection
  6. /stream-status - View detailed current stream status
  7. /stream-update - Add quick timestamped progress notes
  8. /stream-context-check - Monitor context usage and get recommendations
  9. /stream-context-inject - Generate smart context summaries from stream history

  Files Created (12 total):
  - plugin.json - Plugin manifest for Claude Code
  - README.md - Plugin documentation and usage guide
  - .claude/commands/stream-start.md - Stream initialization command
  - .claude/commands/stream-checkpoint.md - Progress checkpoint command

  Session 2 Enhancements (26 minutes):
  - Added stream-context-inject command for intelligent context restoration
  - Enhanced stream-resume to automatically include context injection
  - Integrated smart summarization workflow
  - Tested complete end-to-end workflow including resume with context

  Future Enhancements (Optional):
  - Add error handling for edge cases
  - Implement stream archiving functionality
  - Add stream search/filter capabilities
  - Create stream templates for common workflows
  - Add integration with git branches
  - Export streams to markdown reports

  Context for Future Reference:
  This plugin provides a complete system for managing continuous development work
  across multiple Claude Code sessions. It solves the context window limitation by
  enabling structured checkpoints, resumption, and progress tracking with intelligent
  context restoration. The system is self-documenting through YAML metadata, provides
  smart recommendations for checkpoint timing, and automatically generates condensed
  context summaries (<2000 tokens) when resuming work streams for efficient context
  restoration without overwhelming the context window.
